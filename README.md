# Code Challenge
## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
The convert_to_24_hour function takes a 12-hour time (hour, minute, period) and converts it to 24-hour time. It handles cases like midnight and noon, transforming "8:30 am" to "0830" and "8:30 pm" to "2030". The implementation uses a dictionary for period adjustments.

## Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive
The only_two_positive_numbers function determines if exactly two out of three given integers are positive. It returns True if the condition is met and False otherwise. The implementation counts positive numbers and prints the result for various input combinations.

## Challenge 3: Consonant value
The solve function calculates the highest value of consonant substrings in a given lowercase string. It assigns values to consonants ('a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26) and prints each consonant substring along with its value. The function then returns the highest calculated value.

### Lessons Learned
Handling Edge Cases: Dealing with edge cases, such as midnight and noon in Challenge 1, requires careful consideration and adjustments.

Condition Checking: Challenge 2 demonstrates effective condition checking for specific situations, emphasizing the importance of clear logic.

Substring Processing: Challenge 3 involves processing substrings within a string based on specific criteria, showcasing the flexibility of string manipulation in Python.

These challenges provide practical insights into working with time formats, conditional logic, and string processing in Python.
